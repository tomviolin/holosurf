datasets (sets of holograms) are all stored in directories under 
the "data" subdirectory.  They must be of the form, including the data folder itself:

data/dataset_name/raw
    file01.png
    file02.png
       :   :
    filenn.png

The filenames under the "raw" subdirectory do not need to follow
any given pattern; name them as you will.

The programs/scripts functions are briefly as follows:

src/holo-00-capture.sh   captures images from a image source. Creates
input: cam               a directory "data/cap20YY-MMDD-HHmmss" to store
output: raw/             the images captured. No cropping or other
			 image manipulation is currently done.

src/holo-01-crop.sh      uses ImageMagick's convert command using the
input: raw/              following options:
output: cropped/         -thumbnail 512     resizes the hologram to be
			                    512 pixels wide. The height
					    is adjusted to maintain the 
					    same aspect ratio.
			-crop 512x512+0+128 crops the image to take a 
			                    512x512 region of the image
					    starting 128 pixels down
					    from the top.
			The converted images are given the same names as
			the original names, but placed in a 
src/holo-02-cleanqts.py This program takes the cropped and sized holograms
input: cropped/         and performs neighbor subtraction to gratly reduce
output: holo/           the interference from particles and surfaces
                        that are attached to or are a part of the
			instrumentation, thus leaving the interference
			patterns of objects that were moving from 
			frame to frame.
